Notes about the plan

1) Select a list of 5 countries
2) For each country, calculate the per-capita case count for each day
3) Set the date for country-wide lockdown
4) animate the case count on a graph with x-axis as time and y-axis as the case per capita
5) put a dashed line after a country wide lockdown

6) see if the case rate came down
