        <p>The 2020 Covid-19 virus pandemic has effected the entire world in all walks of life economically, culturally, politically and many other ways. Nations are trying to mitigate the issue in different ways. One such way is enforcing a <em>nationwide lock-down</em> and closing down all non-essential services for a specific period of time.</p>

        <p>This report analyses the merits of such a measure using the <strong>daily case count per country metric as output</strong> vs  parameters like <strong>population</strong> and <strong>dates of lockdown enforcement</strong>. It presents difference between countries which opted for nationwide lockdown and which didn&#39;t.</p>
