        <h2>2) Per-capita % change in daily cases in Countries With Nationwide lockdown</h2>
        
        <p>This chart illustrates the daily case count percentage change between the days on which lockdown was enforced and lifted. The percentages are normalized by per-capita to fit properly.</p>
        <p>We can see that for India, South Africa and Russia, the case count increases even after lockdown.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>TIP</strong>: Hover over the country bar to see the dates on which lockdown was enforced and lifted.
